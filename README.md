# NetPractice

#### Finished in: 2025-02-12

## About

**NetPractice** is a network simulation project from the 42 School curriculum. Its main goal is to build a strong foundation in network design, routing logic, and IP addressing.

The project presents a series of virtual network configurations that must be diagnosed and fixed using a simulator. Each level requires analyzing the connectivity between devices and applying correct subnetting, routing rules, and addressing strategies.

Although this project doesn't involve writing code, itâ€™s highly valuable for:
- Understanding IP classes and subnet masks
- Configuring static routes and gateways
- Troubleshooting packet delivery failures
- Applying real-world network logic in layered systems

## What I Learned

- Fundamentals of IPv4 addressing and subnetting
- Network segmentation and routing logic
- Diagnostics using ping and trace logic
- The importance of clean, maintainable network design

## Note

This repository serves as a placeholder for documentation and reflections on the project. No code was produced, but logical reasoning and problem-solving were key to completing the tasks.
